# PWM
Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) is a technology that uses a on-off time of a (periodic) signal to convey information.

We mainly use it to control **servo motors** and DC motors.

## Principle and Terms

## Generating PWM
There are 2 main components when generating a PWM
- Frequency (1 / T)
- On-time (V HIGH time)
  - or Duty Cycle (On-time / T)

In the following parts, we will try to generate a PWM with 50Hz frequency and 2ms on-time.

### Frequency: MCU Clock & Timer 
The MCU Clock is what determines how fast a MCU (/CPU) can operate.

For our boards, they are usually at 84MHz (84 000 000 instructions in a second!).\
But for our purpose, we only need 50Hz.

So we will be using **timers** inside the board to generate a different frequency.
*Note* a total of 8 timers (TIM0 - TIM8) are available, each can output different frequencies.

#### TIM: PSC & ARR
Each TIMx has some custom parameters that we could set, and we will be using
```c
uint16_t PSC; // Prescaler Value
uint16_t ARR; // Auto Reload Register
```
to slow down the frequency.

- PSC: how many **MCU Clock ticks** to wait before increasing **auto-reloaded counter** (AR counter from now on cus I'm lazy)\
  i.e. if PSC = 1, output is send every (PSC + 1) MCU Clock cycles: 1st MCU clk tick wait, 2nd tick inc
- ARR: max value of auto-reloaded counter\
  i.e. if ARR = 1, *counter overflow* triggers when *AR counter* **exceeds (>)** ARR value, that is every (ARR + 1) *AR counter* counts\
  and it would be **reset to 0** after overflow.

Therefore the output frequency would be:

$Freqency\:Output = \frac{Frequency \: of\:clock}{(Prescaler\:Value+1) \cdot (Auto-reloaded\: counter+1)}$

With the frequency set, we would then make use of the *auto-reloaded counter* value to generate pwm with the desired on-time.

*Note*: We usually prefer a larger ARR value and smaller PSC value since it provides better *resolution* - meaning it can generate more "finely divided" on-time values (since more possible counter values). ~~though higher PSC theoretically have lower power consumption, it doesn't really matter~~

*Extra*: the TIM actually provides much more functionality than just generating PWMs, feel free to explore its parameters and what they do. (NOT NEEDED IN RDC rly)

**ClassWork 1**
- [ ] find 3 pairs of PSC and ARR values to generate a 50Hz output frequency from our board (84GHz).

Note that PSC & ARR values must be integers. You may find prime factorization to be useful.

### On-time: Channels & CRR
We control the on-time by choosing a suitable CRR value for the ARR we have chosen.

For each TIMx, there are 4 channels CHx with their respective CRRx values, allowing us to generate PWMs with different on-times of the **same frequency**.

How does it work? A HIGH signal is output if the *CCR* value is greater than value in the *AR counter*, and LOW other wise.

So $duty cycle = \frac{on-time}{T} = \frac{CCR}{ARR+1}$

**ClassWork 2**
- [ ] find the CRR value for our 50Hz PWM to have 2ms on-time.

## PWM set up in stm32

### Define the PWM features in the IDE

> There are many pins on the board. You need to find out which pin your TIMx_CHx is connected to.

There are 4 steps in setting up the PWM output channel and the pin to use.

1. In catergories, click **Timers** then choose the timer you want to use.

   Setup the **Mode** same as the figure shown. It's fine if you only get 1 channel.

2. Set the **Parameter Settings** same as the figure shown

> Supposedly, You don't have to change anything

3\. **IMPORTANT:** Enable the global interrupt of the timer.

4. Assign the GPIO pin to be the specific timer and channel. e.g Assign the PC7 pin to output the pwm signal of TIM3\_CH2.

### Start Coding!!!

There are 4 steps in coding:

1. Initialize the Timers for PWM

> This should be auto-generated in the beginning of `main.c`

```c
MX_TIM1_Init();
.
.
.
MX_TIM8_Init();
```

2. Set the Prescaler value, Auto Reload Register

```c
// in tutorial3_pwm.c in pwm_init()
TIM1->PSC = 1234;    // set the timer1 prescaler value
TIM1->ARR = 5678;    // set the timer1 auto reload register
```

> Note: `TIM1` stands for Timer 1. but we are using Timer 5 Channel 1 now!!!

> Hint: Use your Classwork 2 answers

3. Start the Timer (in `tutorial3_pwm.c` in `pwm_init()` )

```c
// in tutorial3_pwm.c in pwm_init()
HAL_TIM_PWM_Start(&htim1, TIM_CHANNEL_1); 
// HAL_TIM_PWM_Start(timer, channel);
// htim1 refers to timer 1
// We are using timer 5 channel 1!!!
```

> Hint:  `&htim1` means Timer 1, remember to change to Timer 5

4. Change the CCR as required for the classwork/homework

```c
TIM1->CCR1 = 321; //set the compare value of timer1 channel1
TIM1->CCR2 = 678; //set the compare value of timer1 channel2
```

> Hint: Use your Classwork 2 answers

#### Use the skeleton code `tutorial3_pwm.c` located in the`src` file!!

```c
// add the below in main.c
...
void SystemClock_Config(void);
/* USER CODE BEGIN PFP */

/* add the following 3 lines*/
void pwm_init(void); //add this line!
void pwm_classwork(void); //add this line!
void pwm_homework(void); //add this line!

/* USER CODE END PFP */
...
pwm_init(); //add this line!

while (1) {
    pwm_classwork(); //add this line!
}   
...
```

Now test your PWM with a servo motor!
